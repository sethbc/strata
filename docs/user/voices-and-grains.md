# Voices and Granular Processing

The seven synthesis voices, each voice's granular processor and the per-voice performance features. Back to the [README](../../README.md).

## Seven Synthesis Voices

1. **Resonator** - Filtered noise through resonant filter banks with slow modulation (level-matched to the other voices and limited, so at its normal settings it no longer pushes the rest of the mix down; as a cross-modulation source it is now as strong as the other voices, where before it drove what it modulated to the limit at almost any depth)
2. **FM** - Two-operator FM synthesis with evolving harmonic/inharmonic timbres
3. **Folder** - Sine wave through wavefolder with dynamic folding amount
4. **Sub** - Ultra-low frequency sine wave for grounding the mix
5. **Pulse** - Pulse width modulation synthesis with resonant filtering for classic analog sounds
6. **Karplus** - Karplus-Strong plucked string synthesis for organic, physical timbres
7. **Ring** - Ring modulation between two oscillators for metallic, bell-like textures

## Granular Processing

Each voice has its own granular processor (reading the voice's synth, a buffer or the input; see [Audio Sources and Buffers](sources-and-buffers.md)) with independent control over:
- Grain size (texture density)
- Grain density (grains per second)
- Pitch (0.25x-4x, two octaves either way, with a subtle slow detune drift on unlocked voices). Pitch is each grain's playback rate: an exact transposition with no smearing. A pitch change (drift, an LFO, a scene fade) reaches the next grains, so pitch steps grain by grain instead of gliding. A buffer voice's grains read its sample faster or slower with the pitch, on top of its buffer rate
- Position spread: each grain starts a random distance back in what the voice played, up to half a second at full spread (for a buffer voice, a random offset around its position). It does nothing for a synth or input voice in triggered mode
- History (input-sourced voices only): how far back in the live input the grains play, 0 s (now) to 16 s (60 s on the high performance setting), while the input keeps coming in. Scenes capture it and fade it, and an LFO can move it (`v<i> hist`). Randomize and mutations leave it alone
- Grain envelope (the shape of each grain: hann, sine, perc, linen or trap); scene transitions switch it at the end instead of crossfading, and mutations leave it alone
- Grain mode: **continuous** (grains stream at the grain density) or **triggered** (one grain per trigger; nothing sounds between triggers). The trigger's velocity sets the voice's accent, which the grain carries. Grain density does nothing in triggered mode, and neither does position spread for a voice playing its synth or the input (a buffer-sourced voice still spreads each triggered grain's position). Switching modes fades over about 50 ms instead of clicking. In triggered mode grains fire from pattern steps (and MIDI notes); K3 keeps its start/stop meaning (ALT+K3 locks), so it does not fire grains. The MAIN page shows `[TRIG]` for a voice in triggered mode. Like the envelope, scene transitions switch it at the end and mutations leave it alone

### How the grains play

Every voice's grains read audio that is already there: a synth voice writes its synth into a 4-second loop of its own, an input voice reads the last seconds of the input, and a buffer voice reads its buffer. So a synth or input voice's grains start a few milliseconds in the past. Raising the pitch makes a grain read faster than the audio arrives, so it starts further back: at pitch 2 a grain length back, and at the extremes (pitch 4, 0.5 s grains) 1.5 s back. In triggered mode a grain instead stays close to the trigger: above pitch 2 it is shortened (at pitch 4 a 0.5 s grain lasts 0.17 s), so an accent never arrives late. Input voices now follow pitchbend and frequency cross-modulation, as buffer voices do.

## Performance Features

- **Randomization** - Generate new parameter sets for each voice
- **Lock** - Protect a voice's parameters while others continue to evolve
- **Drift** - A slow random walk adds subtle grain pitch movement to active voices that are not locked; it always drifts back toward the pitch you set
